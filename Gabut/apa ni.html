      <h2>From the Start</h2>

      <p>
        Don't you notice how <br />
        I get quiet when there's no one else around?<br />
        Me and you and awkward silence<br />
        Don't you dare look at me that way<br />
        I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same<br />
        Oh, the burning pain<br />
        Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate<br />
        "She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah<br />
        Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day<br />
        Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say<br />
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br />
        And shoots an arrow through my heart<br />
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br />
        Confess I loved you from the start<br />
        What's a girl to do?<br />
        Lying on my bed, staring into the blue<br />
        Unrequited, terrifying<br />
        Love is driving me a bit insane<br />
        Have to get this off my chest<br />
        I'm telling you today<br />
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br />
        And shoots an arrow through my heart<br />
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br />
        Confess I loved you from the start<br />
        Confess I loved you<br />
        Just thinking of you<br />
        I know I've loved you from the start<br />

      <h2>Here With Me</h2>

      <p>Watch the sunrise along the coast <br>
As we're both getting old <br>
I can't describe what I'm feeling <br>
And all I know is we're going home <br>
So please don't let me go, oh <br>
Don't let me go, oh-oh-oh <br>
And if it's right <br>
I don't care how long it takes <br>
As long as I'm with you <br>
I've got a smile on my face <br>
Save your tears, it'll be okay <br>
All I know is you're here with me <br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh <br>
I can't describe, whoa-oh <br>
I wish I could live through every memory again <br>
Just one more time before we float off in the wind <br>
And all the time we spent <br>
Waiting for the light to take us in <br>
Have been the greatest moments of my life <br>
I don't care how long it takes <br>
As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face <br>
Save your tears, it'll be okay <br>
Yeah, if with me <br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
I can't describe, oh, oh</p>
