      <h2>From the Start</h2>
      <p>
        Don't you notice how <br />
        I get quiet when there's no one else around?<br />
        Me and you and awkward silence<br />
        Don't you dare look at me that way<br />
        I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same<br />
        Oh, the burning pain<br />
        Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate<br />
        "She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah<br />
        Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day<br />
        Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say<br />
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br />
        And shoots an arrow through my heart<br />
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br />
        Confess I loved you from the start<br />
        What's a girl to do?<br />
        Lying on my bed, staring into the blue<br />
        Unrequited, terrifying<br />
        Love is driving me a bit insane<br />
        Have to get this off my chest<br />
        I'm telling you today<br />
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br />
        And shoots an arrow through my heart<br />
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br />
        Confess I loved you from the start<br />
        Confess I loved you<br />
        Just thinking of you<br />
        I know I've loved you from the start<br />

      <h2>Here With Me</h2>

      <p>
        Watch the sunrise along the coast <br />
        As we're both getting old <br />
        I can't describe what I'm feeling <br />
        And all I know is we're going home <br />
        So please don't let me go, oh <br />
        Don't let me go, oh-oh-oh <br />
        And if it's right <br />
        I don't care how long it takes <br />
        As long as I'm with you <br />
        I've got a smile on my face <br />
        Save your tears, it'll be okay <br />
        All I know is you're here with me <br />
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
        Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh <br />
        I can't describe, whoa-oh <br />
        I wish I could live through every memory again <br />
        Just one more time before we float off in the wind <br />
        And all the time we spent <br />
        Waiting for the light to take us in <br />
        Have been the greatest moments of my life <br />
        I don't care how long it takes <br />
        As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face <br />
        Save your tears, it'll be okay <br />
        Yeah, if with me <br />
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
        I can't describe, oh, oh

      <h2>Tek It</h2>

      <p>
        Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate? <br />
        And how much can I be expected to tolerate? Oh<br />
        So I started to think about the plans I made<br />
        The debt, unpaid<br />
        And you just can't call<br />
        A spade a spade<br />
        I watch the moon<br />
        Let it run my mood<br />
        Can't stop thinking of you<br />
        I watch you (now I let it go)<br />
        (And I watch as things play out like)<br />
        So long nice to know you I'll be<br />
        Moving on<br />
        We started off in such a nice place<br />
        We were talking the same language<br />
        I o-open and I'm closing<br />
        You can't stand the thought<br />
        Of a real beating heart<br />
        You'd be holding, having trouble<br />
        O-O-Owning and admit that I am hoping<br />
        I watch the moon<br />
        Let it run my mood<br />
        Can't stop thinking of you<br />
        I watch you (now I let it go)<br />
        (And I watch as things play out like)<br />
        So long nice to know you I'll be<br />
        Moving on<br />
        Moving on<br />
        You<br />
        Yeah, I always know the truth<br />
        But I can't just say it to you<br />
        Yeah, I know the truth<br />
        I knew<br />
        Yeah, I always know the truth<br />
        But I can't just say it to you<br />
        Yeah, I know the truth<br />
        I never thought we'd see it through<br />
        I never could rely on you<br />
        And few times your face came<br />
        Into view<br />
        Into view<br />
        I'm not into you<br />
        Into you<br />
