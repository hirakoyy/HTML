        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
        and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
        Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
        ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
        with the necessary regelialia.

        The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of
        bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little
        Blind Text didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
        into the belt and made herself on the way.

        When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last
        view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
        <b>Alphabet Village</b> and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
        Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
        way. On her way she met a copy.
