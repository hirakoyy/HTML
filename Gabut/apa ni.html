      <h2>From the Start</h2>
      <p>
        Don't you notice how <br />
        I get quiet when there's no one else around?<br />
        Me and you and awkward silence<br />
        Don't you dare look at me that way<br />
        I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same<br />
        Oh, the burning pain<br />
        Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate<br />
        "She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah<br />
        Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day<br />
        Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say<br />
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br />
        And shoots an arrow through my heart<br />
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br />
        Confess I loved you from the start<br />
        What's a girl to do?<br />
        Lying on my bed, staring into the blue<br />
        Unrequited, terrifying<br />
        Love is driving me a bit insane<br />
        Have to get this off my chest<br />
        I'm telling you today<br />
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br />
        And shoots an arrow through my heart<br />
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br />
        Confess I loved you from the start<br />
        Confess I loved you<br />
        Just thinking of you<br />
        I know I've loved you from the start<br />

      <h2>Here With Me</h2>

      <p>
        Watch the sunrise along the coast <br />
        As we're both getting old <br />
        I can't describe what I'm feeling <br />
        And all I know is we're going home <br />
        So please don't let me go, oh <br />
        Don't let me go, oh-oh-oh <br />
        And if it's right <br />
        I don't care how long it takes <br />
        As long as I'm with you <br />
        I've got a smile on my face <br />
        Save your tears, it'll be okay <br />
        All I know is you're here with me <br />
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
        Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh <br />
        I can't describe, whoa-oh <br />
        I wish I could live through every memory again <br />
        Just one more time before we float off in the wind <br />
        And all the time we spent <br />
        Waiting for the light to take us in <br />
        Have been the greatest moments of my life <br />
        I don't care how long it takes <br />
        As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face <br />
        Save your tears, it'll be okay <br />
        Yeah, if with me <br />
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
        I can't describe, oh, oh

      <h2>Tek It</h2>

      <p>
        Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate? <br />
        And how much can I be expected to tolerate? Oh<br />
        So I started to think about the plans I made<br />
        The debt, unpaid<br />
        And you just can't call<br />
        A spade a spade<br />
        I watch the moon<br />
        Let it run my mood<br />
        Can't stop thinking of you<br />
        I watch you (now I let it go)<br />
        (And I watch as things play out like)<br />
        So long nice to know you I'll be<br />
        Moving on<br />
        We started off in such a nice place<br />
        We were talking the same language<br />
        I o-open and I'm closing<br />
        You can't stand the thought<br />
        Of a real beating heart<br />
        You'd be holding, having trouble<br />
        O-O-Owning and admit that I am hoping<br />
        I watch the moon<br />
        Let it run my mood<br />
        Can't stop thinking of you<br />
        I watch you (now I let it go)<br />
        (And I watch as things play out like)<br />
        So long nice to know you I'll be<br />
        Moving on<br />
        Moving on<br />
        You<br />
        Yeah, I always know the truth<br />
        But I can't just say it to you<br />
        Yeah, I know the truth<br />
        I knew<br />
        Yeah, I always know the truth<br />
        But I can't just say it to you<br />
        Yeah, I know the truth<br />
        I never thought we'd see it through<br />
        I never could rely on you<br />
        And few times your face came<br />
        Into view<br />
        Into view<br />
        I'm not into you<br />
        Into you<br />

    <p>[Intro]
Damn, nigga, every time I look at you, I swear to God
Nigga, you got that nigga feet
You got that nigga body
You got that nigga long arms, fingers and shit
Flat feet, big di—

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
She said that I make expressions like him
My legs to my shoulders and my chin like him
My waist and my posture like him
Like him
Like him, like him, like him

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Lola Young]
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
I don't know who he is
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
I don't know where he is
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
Do I look like him? (Like what?)
Like him (Like what?)
Like him (Like what?)
Like him (La-la-la-la)

[Post-Chorus: Lola Young]
(La-la-la-la)</p>
<p>[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Lola Young]
You gave me love and affection
Attention (Go), protection
How could I ever miss somethin' (Go)
That I'd never had?
I would nevеr judge ya
'Cause evеrything worked out without him (Like what?)
Like him (Like what?)
Like him (Huh?)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Baby Keem]
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
I don't know who he is
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
I don't know where he is
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
Do I look
(Huh?)

[Post-Chorus: Lola Young]
Like him
Like him

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Lola Young]
I decided to
Anything that lives inside of you
I would never ever lie to you (Yeah)
You ain't ever gotta lie to me
I'm everything that I've strived to be
So do I look like him?
Do I look like him? (Like him, like him, like him, like him)
I don't look like him
(Like him)</p>
<p>[Outro]
It was my fault, not yours, not his, it was my fault, I'm sorry
You know
It was my fault
Not him, 'cause he always wanted to be there for you
And I'm sorry I was young
But he's always wanted to be a father to you
So I, I fucked up and I take ownership of that
Of my choices and decisions
And I'm sorry for that
He's a good guy
So don't hold that against him, because it was my fault
Just, you know, forgive me</p>
