        Hi, I'm <strong>Hiraki</strong>, but you can call me
        <strong>kii</strong>. I created this site as a personal space where I
        can share my projects, thoughts, and little things I like.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in
        <em>coding, design, languages, and retro web aesthetics</em>. I like
        experimenting with how websites used to feel back in the early 2000s,
        while still keeping them clean and readable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the internet, I enjoy music, drawing, and trying out new
        ideas. This website is kind of like my online diary + portfolio rolled
        into one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to <a href="./contact.html">reach out</a> if you'd like to
        chat or collaborate!
