          Welcome to my blog! I'll be posting here whenever I feel like sharing
          updates, projects I'm working on, or just random thoughts. This site
          is a little experimental space for me to learn and have fun.

          Not feeling well today, but I'll just force myself to study today.
          Wish me luck. :]

          I went home last Friday!! It was for a family gathering on Lembang.
          <br />
          Quite tiring, but it was really fun. <br />Now I'm back, and I'm
          actually supposed to go home this week (according to schedule), but
          since I already did last week, I'm not going again this week.<br />
          I'm gonna be alone in my dorm lmao
